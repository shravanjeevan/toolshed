"title": "My experience with Zoom",
"content": "In the past couple of weeks, both University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay have acknowledged the difficulty of planning for the upcoming fall semester. We don’t envy them. Bacow, in particular, has expressed fear that by the time those decisions will need to be made, there will still be significant uncertainty. And we share those concerns. \nIt’s at this point a hard-worn and oft-repeated fact that pandemics are defined more by their uncontrollable factors than by any obvious, let alone one-dimensional models. And that makes devising and implementing public health policies difficult. Harvard and other research institutions are already hard at work trying to understand the effectiveness of social distancing measures and developing a vaccine. But even assuming perfect knowledge and infinite institutional capability, the question of whether to reopen campus is still complicated by Harvard’s international student body and dense residential setting, as well as legal restrictions beyond the University’s control and the needs of other contingents of our community.",
