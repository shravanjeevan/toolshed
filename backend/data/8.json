The service integrates with the Office 365 subscription office productivity suite and features extensions that can integrate with non-Microsoft products. Microsoft Teams is a competitor to services such as Slack[7] and is the evolution and upgrade path from Microsoft Skype for Business. Microsoft announced Teams at an event in New York, and launched the service worldwide on March 14, 2017.
